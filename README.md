Dice Probabilities
==================

This is a small android app that calculates the probabilities of multiple dice exceeding a specified number.  It is particularly useful when playing the game [Pathfinder the card game](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-of-the-runelor)

The game has borrowed from the interfaces of two other apps:

1. [Dice Probabilties Distributions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lwiklendt.dicepd) which has a limited input system and a wonderful output
2. [nDn Dice Roller](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nDnDiceRoller&hl=en) which has a good input system and a limited output

The main purpose of this project is to allow me to learn both github and android development.
